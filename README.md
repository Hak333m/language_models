A Keras LSTM model trained on small wikipedia dataset

A Tensorflow rnn model trained on Reddit comment datase

Pre-trained word vectors are downloaded from [stanford GloVe Vectors](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)

The Keras character level LSTM model showed interesting result as the following after 35 epoches of training. The sentences starts to make sense after the loss decreased to less than 1.
